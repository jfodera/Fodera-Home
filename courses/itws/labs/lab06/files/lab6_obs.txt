Lab 6 notes: 
Summary: 
Good lab and I got a lot more familliar with Jquery because of it. The most challenging part was probably figuring out a solution to problem 4b
but it was satisfying to get. I also am glad I learned about the toggleClass method because I feel like that will be extremley helpful in the future. 

Response to 4b: 
When I click I my new list item, it turns red, it I click it again it turns black. It works this way because when implementing my solution 
to problem 3 I used the '.on' method. This allows for dynamically added elements to be binded by events, (such as the new list items) to be able to
have their class updated when they are clicked on. Its important to note that I had to specify my 'parent element' (the list itself) in the 
selector in order for the function to work correctly.


to do: 

Before submit: 
uncomment dom loaded alerts

Things I learned: 

ready only executes when entire dom is loaded, it's like the main

supposed to define function in event handler argument

<pre> tag stands for "preformatted text." It is used to display text exactly as it appears in the HTML code

.slideToggle

When writing inline, thats when you use the noconflict thign with '$'

Fade out function number argument represents miliseconds

Can change the cursor type in css

Toggle class extremley helpful 

Must use selector of parent element (after $) when using .on method
