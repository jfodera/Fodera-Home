Summary: 
   Very different lab than the ones prior but I learned a lot and I think will be very useful for the future. Glad I now know what php
   and mySQL are and how easy it is to make databases, implementent relationship tables and things like that. Didn't run into a lot of issues 
   here as the in-class material helped me to get a good grasp of the concepts that we were working with

Plan: 
   Be sure to link it to labs Homepage and change links above
   be sure to re-do actors csv and image 

Current: 
   on step 2

Things I learned: 
   SQl file is what phpMy admin reads
