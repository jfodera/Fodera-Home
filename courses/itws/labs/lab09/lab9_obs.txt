Lab 9 notes: 

Summary: 
   I really liked this lab as I put together a lot of different peices. Below I listed everything I learned and a couple of questions I had. I used some jquery methods 
   that I got from lab 6 to make the text appear and disappear on click while also combining that with ajax hide statements I used in lab 8 so that was pretty cool. I was
   just curious as to why I didn't have to use the 'on' method to show/hide my feed objects but I guessed it was because we were using ajax to load them in and not 
   "dynamically creating them using jQuery methods. Probably my best page (functionality wise) to date and nice to see improvement. 

Plan: 
make it like landing page from lab 4 with header and all of that, when cllick on RSS it appears using "show" method from prior lab
be sure to have scroll on
   add Atom Styled after the link button
   same thing when clicking on atom, 


Current: 
   making RSS box 

Before submit:

Questions: 
   why do I not have to use on method to fade in and out? 
      could it be because the elements were added through ajax function which has different implications then adding them through jquery functions from lab6 

Things I learned: 
     border: 1px solid black;
     href="#" -> default placeholder 
      Centers every div:
         width: 30%;
         margin: auto;
         text-align: center;
      target='_blank' -> open in new window
      must include js defining script before javascript file in header
      footerPadding Strategy

Future Notes: 
   Fix lab6 Footer
