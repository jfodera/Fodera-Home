You are to use the RSS & Atom feeds that you created in lab 4 and create a new lab 10 page which will serve the data in a presentable format.

Copy your main branch into Development √
Make sure you are working in you rdevelopment branch √
Follwing the AJAX example provided in class, and 'old lab 7' √
Create a new la9.html and lab9.js file in your lab9 folder (or similar, according to your IA) √
When opening lab9.html, the page should read your RSS and ATOM files from lab 9 and put them on the page √

Rubric:
33% - outputting the RSS feed
33% - outputting the ATOM feed 
33% - making the style fancier and 'fitting' it to your site

You may put both outputs on the same page - or not, your choice. √
When done, promote your development environment to production and deploy.  Failure to do this will resut in no credit √
Dont forget your READme - failure to include one will result in no credit √
