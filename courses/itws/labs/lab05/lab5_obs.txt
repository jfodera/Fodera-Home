Lab 5 notes: 
Summary: This lab was probably my favorite as I really enjoyed bridging the gap from html to javascript. It definitley helped 
that I had a bit of background in javascript and it was just cool to finally apply some things that I knew prior to this class. 
The event Attributes were very interesting to me and when reading through some documentation, I was able to think of a lot of 
use cases for them. I'm excited to hopefully further implement javascript into our group project.


Plan: 

if form is submitted sucessfully, alert user


: on first load of the page, focus the first form element. (No points will be deducted for not doing this.)
   this means make the cursor be in the first element box on the first load of the page. 



Questions: 

How do we actually acsess responses once we hit submit? 


to do: 

Add multiple error messages if missing form feilds √
make sure when fields are empty button doesn't alert 'is' √ 
make sure to not submit form when comments are default √


Things I learned: 

textarea and input elements are two different Things
   value in text area defines what is pre-loaded in box

onsubmit attribute in a form

reasoning only clears once for onlick is because inner html is not changed when user adds comments 

onblur is called when element goes out of focus 

displaying value takes precedence over inner html

Always associate form labes with form input fields

setFocus sets defaults when screen first loads

Onsubmit functions must return true/false depending on if form was submitted succesfully
