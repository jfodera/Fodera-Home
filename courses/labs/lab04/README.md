Summary: Was interesting to see the slight differences in syntax between Atom and RSS. Was also nice to get a deeper understanding of what a 
XML microformat really is. Cool curating my own feed and excited to hopefully play with RSS and Atom more in the future. Also just had a fun 
time styling my lab 4 landing. 

Plan: 

make a lab 4 landing page with links to the 2 files


Both feeds can be identical, just want us to be able to use both atom and RSS. 

Note: RSS readers should be able to read atom just fine


Questions: 
Why can't I define hover for a class

Why can't I make background image fill entire div?

Missing atom:link with rel="self"? Validator RSS reccomendation 


to do: 
make description not go over header.   


Things I learned: 

Can't make body a relative height 
Each atom entry should have a summary. 
Don't need CDATA in RSS but it tells program that it's text not markup 

future notes: 
style RSS in the future
