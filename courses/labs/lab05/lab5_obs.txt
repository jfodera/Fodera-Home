Lab 5 notes: 
Summary: 


Plan: 

If form is submitted sucessfully, alert user

: on first load of the page, focus the first form element. (No points will be deducted for not doing this.)
   this means make the cursor be in the first element box on the first load of the page. 



Questions: 

How do we actually acsess responses once we hit submit? 

Is there a way to do exitArea function without using .value

What is the point of #output?

to do: 



Things I learned: 

textarea and input elements are two different Things
   value in text area defines what is pre-loaded in box

onsubmit attribute in a form

reasoning only clears once for onlick is because inner html is not changed when user adds comments 

onblur is called when element goes out of focus 

displaying value takes precedence over inner html

Always associate form labes with form input fields
