      must have links to labs, and have a landing page for each lab

Conventions: 

filesheets have same name as html they are used for, just different extension

Use rel URL's for importing CSS, server relative for actual link

Questions: 
Are the # of files in my root good? 


Things I learned: 

display: block; - allows you to set height and width for links

cannot legally make button a link 

Must make server relative calls

%'s are based off of container within

Do widths in percentages to resize with windo 

make seperate css files (external file sheet): 
   Thinks about good organization, don't replicate 

Wrap means to be able to move to next line when screen minimizes

<em> </em> makes things itallic

'rel' attribute tells html how to interact with link
